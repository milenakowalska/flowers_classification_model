# Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a simple machine learning experiment focused on classifying different types of flowers based on their features. It demonstrates the full workflow - from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
In the project I used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 🔍 Steps

1. Data Exploration - Performed an initial analysis to understand the dataset.

2. Data Normalization - Applied StandardScaler to standardize feature values (mean = 0, std = 1).

3. Model Building - Trained a K-Neighbors Classifier on the processed dataset.

4. Evaluation – The model achieved an accuracy of 96.6%, indicating strong predictive performance.

5. Data Visualization – Created boxplots to explore feature distributions and detect potential outliers.

6. ANOVA Test – Performed analysis of variance to evaluate the statistical significance of each feature.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries

- Python

- scikit-learn

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib and seaborn (for visualization)

## 📊 Result

Model's accuracy: 96.6%.

ANOVA Test: All features produced very small p-values (< 0.001), indicating high statistical significance and strong relevance to the target variable.
